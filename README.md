# True-and-false-interindividual-differences-in-the-physiological-response-to-an-intervention

I perform a simulation of a randomised control trial demonstrating why it is wrong to analyse arms of a trial separately looking to identify responders and non responders. There are two examples the main difference being one simulation is based on parameters I made up whilst the other used the example in Stephen Senn's BMJ paper (see the reference in my example)
